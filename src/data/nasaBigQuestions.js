<p><strong>Weather</strong> describes the conditions outside right now in a specific place. For example, if you see that it’s raining outside right now, that’s a way to describe today’s weather. Rain, snow, wind, hurricanes, tornadoes — these are all weather events.</p>

<p><strong>Climate</strong>, on the other hand, is more than just one or two rainy days. Climate describes the weather conditions that are expected in a region at a particular time of year.</p>

<p>Is it usually rainy or usually dry? Is it typically hot or typically cold? A region’s climate is determined by observing its weather over a period of many years—generally 30 years or more.</p>

<p>So, for example, one or two weeks of rainy <strong>weather</strong> wouldn’t change the fact that Phoenix typically has a dry, desert <strong>climate</strong>. Even though it’s rainy right now, we still expect Phoenix to be dry because that's what is usually the case.</p>

<p>Climate change describes a change in the average conditions — such as temperature and rainfall — in a region over a long period of time. For example, 20,000 years ago, much of the United States was covered in glaciers. In the United States today, we have a warmer climate and fewer glaciers.</p>

<p>Global climate change refers to the average long-term changes over the entire Earth. These include warming temperatures and changes in precipitation, as well as the effects of Earth’s warming, such as:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Rising sea levels</li>
	<li>Shrinking mountain glaciers</li>
	<li>Ice melting at a faster rate than usual in Greenland, Antarctica and the Arctic</li>
	<li>Changes in flower and plant blooming times. </li>
</ul>

<p>Earth’s climate has constantly been changing — even long before humans came into the picture. However, scientists have observed unusual changes recently. For example, Earth’s average temperature has been increasing much more quickly than they would expect over the past 150 years. </p>

<p>Some parts of Earth are warming faster than others. But on average, global air temperatures near Earth's surface have gone up about 2 degrees Fahrenheit in the past 100 years. In fact, the past five years have been the warmest five years in centuries.</p>

<p>Many people, including scientists, are concerned about this warming. As Earth’s climate continues to warm, the intensity and amount of rainfall during storms such as hurricanes is expected to increase. Droughts and heat waves are also expected to become more intense as the climate warms.</p>

<p>When the whole Earth’s temperature changes by one or two degrees, that change can have big impacts on the health of Earth's plants and animals, too.</p>

<h2>What Causes Climate Change?</h2>

	</figure>
</div>

<p>There are lots of factors that contribute to Earth’s climate. However, scientists agree that Earth has been getting warmer in the past 50 to 100 years due to human activities.</p>

<p>Certain gases in Earth’s atmosphere block heat from escaping. This is called the <a href="https://climatekids.nasa.gov/greenhouse-effect">greenhouse effect</a>. These gases keep Earth warm like the glass in a greenhouse keeps plants warm.</p>

<p>Human activities — such as burning fuel to power factories, cars and buses — are changing the natural greenhouse. These changes cause the atmosphere to trap more heat than it used to, leading to a warmer Earth.</p>

</div>

<p>Yes. When human activities create greenhouse gases, Earth warms. This matters because oceans, land, air, plants, animals and energy from the Sun all have an effect on one another. The combined effects of all these things give us our <strong>global climate</strong>. In other words, Earth’s climate functions like one big, connected system.</p>

<p>Thinking about things as systems means looking for how every part relates to others. NASA’s Earth observing satellites collect information about how our planet’s <a href="https://climatekids.nasa.gov/menu/atmosphere">atmosphere</a>, <a href="https://climatekids.nasa.gov/menu/water">water</a> and land are changing.</p>

<p>By looking at this information, scientists can observe how Earth’s systems work together. This will help us understand how small changes in one place can contribute to bigger changes in Earth’s global climate.</p>`)

    title: 'Why Is Carbon Important?',

    contentHtml: stripInlineStyles(`<h2>Short Answer</h2>
<div class="nasa-short-answer"><div><strong>The Short Answer:</strong></div>
<div>
        Carbon is in carbon dioxide, which is a greenhouse gas that traps heat close to Earth. It helps Earth hold some of the heat it receives from the Sun so it doesn't all escape back into space. But CO<sub>2</sub> is only good up to a point – beyond that point, Earth's temperature warms up too much. NASA research satellites such as OCO-2 and OCO-3 are studying how carbon moves around the planet.
      </div>

<br>
<h2 class="green">What is carbon?</h2>
<p>Take a deep breath in. And breathe out. You just exhaled carbon dioxide!</p>
<br>
<figure class="image-with-caption center">
	<img src="https://climatekids.nasa.gov/carbon/exhale-carbon-dioxide.png" alt="This graphic depicts a black silhouette of a human exhaling carbon dioxide. White arrows illustrate the direction of the flow of CO<sub>2</sub>  away from the human silhouette's mouth.">
	<figcaption>Humans exhale carbon dioxide. Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech.</figcaption>
</figure>
<br>
<p>All living things on Earth contain carbon. Even you contain carbon. Lots of it! Like every other living thing on this planet, we are a part of Earth's carbon cycle. Plants take in CO<sub>2</sub>. They keep the carbon and give away the oxygen. Animals breathe in the oxygen and breathe out carbon dioxide. Carbon, including carbon dioxide, has cycled into and out of the air for a long time. This cycling of carbon has stayed balanced over long periods of time.</p>

<br>
<figure class="image-with-caption center">
	<img src="https://climatekids.nasa.gov/carbon/carbon-cycle.jpg" alt="This infographic demonstrates how carbon dioxide cycles through the environment through vegetation, soils, fires, and the burning of fossil fuels. A digital rendering of a flat landscape shows the different sources of carbon on our planet. From left to right, the landscape shows green trees and vegetation, dark-colored pillars next to a factory building producing smoke plumes, a cow crazing, and lastly, a fire burning green trees and emitting a thick cloud of smoke. Above each of these elements are yellow up-and-down arrows depicting how carbon moves as a result of these processes.">

<br>
<h2 class="green">What is carbon dioxide?</h2>
<p>Carbon dioxide is an important gas for life on the planet. (Remember our deep breath in and out?) It is crucial to maintaining the protective blanket that is Earth's atmosphere. Carbon dioxide is often called "C-O-2" (pronounced see-oh-two) and written as "CO<sub>2</sub>" because "C" stands for carbon and "O" stands for oxygen. Carbon dioxide is one of the primary greenhouse gases on Earth.</p>

<br>
<figure class="image-with-caption center">
	<img src="https://climatekids.nasa.gov/carbon/carbon-dioxide.png" alt="This graphic illustrates the elements that make up a carbon dioxide molecule: one carbon atom and two oxygen atoms.">
	<figcaption>Carbon dioxide is called CO<sub>2</sub> because it has two oxygen atoms attached to one carbon atom. This illustration of a carbon dioxide molecule shows a larger carbon atom (labeled with a C) between two oxygen atoms (labeled with an O). Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech.</figcaption>
</figure>
<br>
<p>Greenhouse gases trap heat from the Sun. Without greenhouse gases, that heat would escape Earth's atmosphere and go back into space. Human activities, such as burning fossil fuels and cutting down forests, are changing the balance between how much carbon is in the air and how much carbon is stored in plants and the ocean. These activities cause the amount of CO<sub>2</sub> in the air to rise. Big increases in CO<sub>2</sub> in our atmosphere can negatively affect Earth's climate.</p>

<br>
<figure class="image-with-caption center">
	<img src="https://climatekids.nasa.gov/carbon/greenhouse.jpg" alt="This graphic shows how the Sun's energy is captured inside of a greenhouse to keep plants warm. A yellow circle in the top left corner of the illustration, representing the Sun, emits light yellow arrows that travel into the illustration of a greenhouse. The greenhouse, seen growing green vegetation with red berries, is on top of snow and to the right of a snowman with a carrot nose and black top hat. The yellow arrows depict how heat energy enters a greenhouse and is trapped inside, heating the interior while the outside environment stays cold.">

	<img src="https://climatekids.nasa.gov/carbon/earths-atmosphere-traps-some-of-the-suns-heat.png" alt="This graphic shows how Earth's atmosphere acts as a greenhouse for the Sun's energy. In this illustration, the Sun appears in the top left corner. Earth is in the bottom right corner, outlined by a thick blue ring labeled \"Atmosphere.\" Three arrows of varying colors travel from the Sun toward Earth. One arrow points directly at the atmosphere, but does not cross into the atmosphere. The second (middle) arrow penetrates the outline of the atmosphere and points directly at Earth. The last and rightmost arrow is traveling to the atmosphere and bouncing off, sending the arrow into the opposite direction. In the bottom left corner of the illustration is a thermometer. These arrows demonstrate how the Sun's heat energy either stops before it reaches the atmosphere, penetrates and stays within the atmosphere, or bounces off the atmosphere back into space.">

<br>
<h2 class="green">So is carbon dioxide bad?</h2>
<p>Here's the big, important thing about CO<sub>2</sub>: It's a greenhouse gas. That means CO<sub>2</sub> in the atmosphere traps heat close to Earth. It helps our planet hold onto some of the heat it gets from the Sun so the energy doesn't all escape back into space.</p>

<br>
<figure class="image-with-caption center">
	<img src="https://climatekids.nasa.gov/carbon/simplified_animation_of_the_greenhouse_effect.gif" alt="This animated graphic shows how Earth's atmosphere acts as a greenhouse for the Sun's energy. Titled \"The Greenhouse Effect,\" this gif uses text and animated arrows to show how the Sun's heat energy interacts with Earth's atmosphere. The text in the gif says, \"Sunlight reaches the Earth. Some energy is reflected back into space. Some energy is absorbed and re-radiated as heat. Most of the heat is absorbed by greenhouse gases and then radiated in all directions, warming the Earth.\"">

</figure>
<br>
<p>If it weren't for this greenhouse effect, Earth's ocean would be frozen solid. If not for the greenhouse effect, Earth would be an ice ball! Earth would not be the beautiful blue and green planet of life that it is.</p>

<br>
<figure class="image-with-caption center">
	<img src="https://climatekids.nasa.gov/carbon/bg4-12.jpg" alt="These side-by-side pictures of Earth compare what our planet would look like if Earth's atmosphere did not act like a greenhouse!

</figure>
<br>
<p>So, CO<sub>2</sub> and other greenhouse gases are good — but only up to a point. CO<sub>2</sub> is so good at holding in heat from the Sun that even a small increase in CO<sub>2</sub> in the atmosphere can make Earth even warmer.</p>

<br>
<figure class="image-with-caption center">
	<img src="https://climatekids.nasa.gov/carbon/caron-dioxide-card.png" alt="These graphics show the good (natural) and the bad (dangerous and less natural) sides of carbon dioxide. The graphic on the left describes the good and natural effects of carbon dioxide: \"Made up of carbon and oxygen, CO<sub>2</sub> is all around us naturally. It comes from decaying and living organisms, and from volcanoes.\" The graphic on the right describes the bad and less natural effects of carbon dioxide: \"CO<sub>2</sub> is released when burning fossil fuels such as coal and oil. This greenhouse gas is the most important contributor to human-caused global warming.\"">

</figure>
<br>
<p>Throughout Earth's history, whenever the amount of CO<sub>2</sub> in the atmosphere has gone up, the temperature of Earth has also gone up. And when the temperature rises, CO<sub>2</sub> levels in the atmosphere increase even more, mostly because of the role the ocean plays in the carbon cycle. As ocean temperatures increase, oceans release stored carbon dioxide into the atmosphere – like a glass of soda losing its bubbles on a warm day.</p>

<h2 class="green">How is NASA learning about carbon dioxide?</h2>
<p>How is our planet handling this change to one of the key elements of life on Earth? To answer that, we need to keep a close eye on carbon. We need to know how and where it is entering and leaving the atmosphere and how it is interacting with weather and climate.</p>
<p>NASA's research satellites are studying how carbon moves around the planet.</p>
<p>NASA's Orbiting Carbon Observatory 2, or OCO-2, launched in 2014 to measure CO<sub>2</sub> to better observe Earth's carbon cycle. OCO-2 investigates important questions about carbon dioxide on Earth all the way from space! NASA's OCO-2 also helps explore how measurements from space can predict future CO<sub>2</sub> increases and its impact on Earth's climate.</p>

    sourceUrl: 'https://climatekids.nasa.gov/greenhouse-effect/',
    byline: 'NASA Climate Kids',
    contentHtml: stripInlineStyles(`<h2>How does the greenhouse effect work?</h2>
<p>As you might expect from the name, the greenhouse effect works … like a greenhouse! A greenhouse is a building with glass walls and a glass roof. Greenhouses are used to grow plants, such as tomatoes and tropical flowers.</p>
<p>A greenhouse stays warm inside, even during the winter. In the daytime, sunlight shines into the greenhouse and warms the plants and air inside. At nighttime, it's colder outside, but the greenhouse stays pretty warm inside. That's because the glass walls of the greenhouse trap the Sun's heat.</p>
<figure>
  <img src="https://climatekids.nasa.gov/greenhouse-effect/greenhouse-traps-heat.jpg" alt="Illustration of a greenhouse in the snow with rays of sunlight entering it. The greenhouse is capturing the heat. A snowman is off to the side of the greenhouse." />
  <figcaption>A greenhouse captures heat from the Sun during the day. Its glass walls trap the Sun's heat, which keeps plants inside the greenhouse warm — even on cold nights. Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The greenhouse effect works much the same way on Earth. Gases in the atmosphere, such as <a href="https://climatekids.nasa.gov/greenhouse-effect-and-carbon-cycle/">carbon dioxide</a>, trap heat similar to the glass roof of a greenhouse. These heat-trapping gases are called <a href="https://climatekids.nasa.gov/greenhouse-cards/">greenhouse gases</a>.</p>
<p>During the day, the Sun shines through the atmosphere. Earth's surface warms up in the sunlight. At night, Earth's surface cools, releasing heat back into the air. But some of the heat is trapped by the greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. That's what keeps our Earth a warm and cozy 58 degrees Fahrenheit (14 degrees Celsius), on average.</p>

</figure>
<h2>How are humans impacting the greenhouse effect?</h2>
<p>Human activities are changing Earth's natural greenhouse effect. Burning fossil fuels like coal and oil puts more carbon dioxide into our atmosphere.</p>
<p>NASA has observed increases in the amount of carbon dioxide and some other greenhouse gases in our atmosphere. Too much of these greenhouse gases can cause Earth's atmosphere to trap more and more heat. This causes Earth to warm up.</p>
<h2>What reduces the greenhouse effect on Earth?</h2>
<p>Just like a glass greenhouse, Earth's greenhouse is also full of plants! Plants can help to balance the greenhouse effect on Earth. All plants — from giant trees to tiny phytoplankton in the ocean — take in carbon dioxide and give off oxygen.</p>
<p>The ocean also absorbs a lot of excess carbon dioxide in the air. Unfortunately, the increased carbon dioxide in the ocean changes the water, making it more acidic. This is called <a href="https://climatekids.nasa.gov/acidocean/">ocean acidification</a>.</p>
<p>More acidic water can be harmful to many ocean creatures, such as certain shellfish and coral. Warming oceans — from too many greenhouse gases in the atmosphere — can also be harmful to these organisms. Warmer waters are a main cause of <a href="https://climatekids.nasa.gov/coral-bleaching/">coral bleaching</a>.</p>

    <div><strong>The Short Answer:</strong></div>
    <p>Scientists have been observing Earth for a long time. They use NASA satellites and other instruments to collect many types of information about Earth's land, atmosphere, ocean and ice. This information tells us that Earth's climate is getting warmer.</p>

  <h2>Why is Earth getting warmer?</h2>
  <div class="image-with-caption center">
    <figure>
      <img src="https://climatekids.nasa.gov/earth-temperature.gif" alt="Animation of the Earth with a thermometer with temperature rising.">
      <figcaption>We can't take Earth's temperature directly, but we do have a lot of information from weather stations, ocean buoys and remote sensing instruments. The information lets us see changes in climate. Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech</figcaption>
    </figure>
  </div>
  <p>Extra <a href="https://climatekids.nasa.gov/greenhouse-effect/" target="_blank">greenhouse gases</a> in our atmosphere are the main reason that Earth is getting warmer. Greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) and methane, trap the Sun's heat in Earth's atmosphere.</p>
  <p>It's normal for there to be some greenhouse gases in our atmosphere. They help keep Earth warm enough to live on. But too many greenhouse gases can cause too much warming.</p>
  <p>The burning of fossil fuels like coal and oil increase the amount of CO<sub>2</sub> in our air. This happens because the burning process combines carbon with oxygen in the air to make CO<sub>2</sub>.</p>
  <p>It's important that we monitor CO<sub>2</sub> levels, because too much CO<sub>2</sub> can cause too much warming on Earth. Several NASA missions have instruments that study CO<sub>2</sub> in the atmosphere.</p>

  <h2>Why does it matter that Earth's Climate is changing?</h2>
  <p>Over millions of years, Earth's climate has warmed up and cooled down many times. However, today the planet is warming much faster than it has over human history.</p>
  <p>Global air temperatures near Earth's surface have gone up about 2 degrees Fahrenheit in the last century. In fact, the past five years have been the warmest five years in centuries.</p>
  <p>A couple of degrees may not seem like much. However, this change can have big impacts on the health of Earth's plants and animals.</p>

  <h2>How do we know what Earth's climate was like long ago?</h2>
  <div class="image-with-caption center">
    <figure>
      <img src="https://climatekids.nasa.gov/ice-core-photo.jpg" alt="Photograph of a hand holding an ice core.">
      <figcaption>An ice core. Credit: NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center/Ludovic Brucker</figcaption>
    </figure>
  </div>
  <p>We know what Earth's past climate was like by studying things that have been around for a long time. For example, scientists can study what Earth's climate was like hundreds of years ago by studying the insides of <a href="https://climatekids.nasa.gov/tree-rings/">trees</a> that have been alive since then.</p>
  <p>But if scientists want to know what Earth's climate was like hundreds of thousands to millions of years ago, they study <strong>sediment cores</strong> and <strong>ice cores</strong>. Sediment cores come from the bottoms of lakes or the ocean floor. Ice cores are drilled from deep — sometimes miles — below the surface of the ice in places like Antarctica.</p>
  <p>A drilled ice core kind of looks like what you get if you plunge a drinking straw into a slushy drink and pull it out with your finger over the end of the straw.</p>
  <p>The layers in an ice core are frozen solid. These layers of ice give clues about every year of Earth's history back to the time the deepest layer was formed. The ice contains bubbles of the air from each year. Scientists analyze the bubbles in each layer to see how much CO<sub>2</sub> they contain.</p>
  <div class="image-with-caption center">
    <figure>
      <img src="https://climatekids.nasa.gov/ice-core-illustration.jpg" alt="Illustration of an ice core.">
      <figcaption>Each layer in an ice core tells scientists something about Earth's past. Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech</figcaption>
    </figure>
  </div>
  <p>Scientists can also use ice cores to learn about the temperatures for each year. As snow accumulates onto a growing glacier, the temperature of the air imprints onto the water molecules in the ice.</p>
  <p>Scientists who use trees, ice cores, and lake and ocean sediment to study Earth's climate are called <strong>paleoclimatologists</strong>. They look at all of these sources of information and compare their findings to see if they match up. If they do, then their findings are accepted as being most likely true. If the findings don't agree, the scientists do more studies and collect more information.</p>
  <p>In the case of Earth's climate history, the results from many different kinds of studies agree.</p>

  <h2>How can so little warming cause so much melting?</h2>
  <p>It takes a lot of energy to warm up water. However, the oceans do absorb heat, and they do get warmer. This warmer water causes sea ice to begin to melt in the Arctic.</p>
  <p>Information from NASA's Earth satellites shows us that every summer, some Arctic ice melts and shrinks, getting smallest by September. Then, when winter comes, the ice grows again. But since 1979, the September ice has been getting smaller and smaller and thinner and thinner. So, just a small amount of warming can have a huge effect over several years.</p>

  <p><a href="https://climatekids.nasa.gov/10-things-glaciers/">Glaciers</a> are another form of melting, shrinking ice. Glaciers are like frozen rivers. They flow over land like rivers, only they move much slower. Warmer temperatures cause them to flow more quickly. Many of them flow toward the ocean, breaking into huge chunks that fall into the water.</p>

  <h2>What does sea level tell us about climate change?</h2>
  <p>More glaciers are melting into the ocean, and the global sea level is rising. Sea level rise is another clue that tells us Earth's climate is getting warmer. But melting ice is not the only cause of rising sea levels. As the ocean gets warmer, the water actually expands! Scientists have observed that the sea level has risen 7 inches in the last 100 years.</p>

      <div>
          The ocean covers about 70% of Earth’s surface. So, it’s not surprising that it plays a large part in Earth’s environment. As Earth warms, water in the ocean soaks up energy (heat) and distributes it more evenly across the planet. The ocean also absorbs carbon dioxide from Earth’s atmosphere. The additional heat and carbon dioxide in the ocean can change the environment for the many plants and animals that live there.

    <h2>Why is the ocean important for life on Earth?</h2>

    <p>The ocean is important because it is a very large part of our planet. In fact, it covers 70% of Earth’s surface. The ocean is a home and food source for countless fish, mammals, plants, birds, and more.</p>

    <p>The ocean plays an important role in whatever happens in our environment on Earth. Even if you live on land – like humans do – you wouldn’t survive without the ocean!</p>

    <p>One example: without the ocean, Earth would be much hotter than it is right now. That’s because the ocean absorbs heat from the Sun and spreads it more evenly around our planet.</p>

    <br>

    <h2>How does the ocean soak up heat from the Sun?</h2>

    <figure class="image-with-caption center">
      <img src="https://climatekids.nasa.gov/ocean/water-storing-heat.png" alt="Cartoon of the Sun and Earth, with the Earth's oceans absorbing heat, and a water balloon with a lit match below it.">
      <figcaption>Earth’s oceans help to absorb extra heat from the atmosphere because water is good at storing heat. How do you think a balloon filled with water would react to a flame differently than a balloon filled with air? Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>Water is excellent at storing heat. Water has a high heat capacity—it absorbs a lot of heat before it begins to get hot. Air, on the other hand, is not so great at storing heat.</p>

    <p>Earth’s climate is warming due to human activities. As Earth experiences a warming climate, we experience hotter air temperatures. The ocean does an excellent job of absorbing the extra heat from the atmosphere, delaying the full impact of global warming.</p>

    <p>The top few meters of the ocean store as much heat as Earth's entire atmosphere. So, as the planet warms, it's the ocean that gets most of the extra energy. More than 90% of the global warming is going into the ocean.</p>

    <p>But if the ocean gets too warm, then the plants and animals that live there can get sick or even die.</p>

    <h2>How are coral reefs affected by climate change?</h2>

    <p>Coral reefs are created by living creatures. Warming oceans caused by climate change are putting coral reefs in danger. Coral reefs are made by very fragile colonies of organisms that build skeletons around themselves.</p>

    <p>Coral lives together with a certain kind of colorful algae. The algae make food using sunlight ¬– a process called photosynthesis. The algae share the food with the coral, and in turn, the coral gives the algae a safe and comfortable place to live.</p>

    <p>The two of them get along fine, living in clean, clear, shallow waters where the Sun shines through brightly. Fish and other sea creatures love coral too, because there are lots of nooks and crannies for them to hide in.</p>

    <p>But the algae cannot carry out photosynthesis in water that is too warm. The algae either die, or the coral spits it out. It's bad for the algae, the coral and the fish, because the coral lose their food sources and become weak and can die. This event is called <a href="https://climatekids.nasa.gov/coral-bleaching/">coral bleaching</a>, and it is a very serious problem in many ocean ecosystems around the world.</p>

    <h2>How does the ocean soak up CO<sub>2</sub>?</h2>

    <p>Fish and other animals in the ocean breathe oxygen and give off carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>), just like land animals. Ocean plants take in the carbon dioxide and produce oxygen, just like land plants. The ocean is great at absorbing CO<sub>2</sub> from the air.</p>

    <p>However, a lot of CO<sub>2</sub> comes from human activities, too. For example, exhaust from cars, planes, and factories put extra carbon dioxide into our air. Too much carbon dioxide in the air is a problem, as it causes the Earth to trap more heat. The ocean absorbs about one-quarter of the CO<sub>2</sub> that humans create when we burn fossil fuels (oil, coal, and natural gas).</p>

    <p>Too much carbon dioxide in the ocean causes a problem called ocean acidification. You can <a href="https://climatekids.nasa.gov/acid-ocean/">read this article to learn all about ocean acidification and its effects</a>.</p>

    <h2>How does the ocean affect the climate?</h2>

    <p>The ocean absorbs heat from the Sun and ocean currents move that warm water all around the planet. Ocean currents are like highways that carry water around the world. Heat (along with salt) is a major source of power for ocean currents.</p>

    <p>Cold water near the North and South Poles sinks deeper into the ocean. Water near the equator is warmed by the Sun. Then, the warm surface water moves closer to the poles where it cools and sinks.</p>

    <figure class="image-with-caption center">
      <img src="https://climatekids.nasa.gov/ocean/great-ocean-conveyor-belt.png" alt="A map of the Earth with arrows indicating ocean currents moving warm water from the equator to the poles and ocean currents moving cold water from the poles back to the equator.">
      <figcaption>The "great ocean conveyor belt" refers to the major ocean currents that move warm water from the equator to the poles and cold water from the poles back toward the equator. Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>As Earth’s climate warms, the water also warms melting sea ice. This warming could make the water less cold and less likely to sink. Without sinking cold water, the ocean currents could slow down or stop in some places. This could change the climate in places like Europe that have milder climates thanks to the warm currents in the oceans around them.</p>

    <br>

    <h2>Does the salt in the ocean do anything?</h2>

    <figure class="image-with-caption center">
      <img src="https://climatekids.nasa.gov/ocean/salinity.png" alt="Graphic showing the saltiness of various types of water, with river (fresh water) at the top as least salty, estuary (brackish water) in the middle, and ocean at the bottom as most salty.">
      <figcaption>Fresh water has lower salinity (saltiness) than estuary water, where the ocean water mixes with river water. The ocean itself is the most salty of all. Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>The amount of salt in the ocean also affects currents. Saltier water is heavier than less salty water. When salty ocean water freezes, the ice can no longer hold on to the salt. Instead, the salt mixes with the water below making it saltier and heavier. Glaciers, land ice and icebergs are made of fresh water, so what happens when this ice melts? Good question!</p>

    <p>The water in the North Atlantic sinks because it's cold, but also because it's salty. Being both cold and salty makes it really dense and heavy, so it can sink very far. But if too much ice melts in the North Atlantic, the water could become less salty and affect ocean currents. NASA satellites are keeping a close eye on the melting ice, the ocean currents, and ocean life to better understand this complicated system.</p>

    <h2>How does climate change impact sea level?</h2>

    <figure class="image-with-caption center">
      <img src="https://climatekids.nasa.gov/ocean/sea-levels-are-rising.png" alt="Cartoon of a beach with a palm tree next to the ocean with a ruler sticking out of the water under a mostly clear sky.">
      <figcaption>As Earth warms, sea levels are rising. Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>As Earth warms, NASA has observed that sea levels are rising. Water expands as it gets warmer. So, warm water takes up more room in our oceans, and this leads to higher sea levels.</p>

    <p>Another reason that oceans are rising is due to melting ice on land. Glaciers and ice sheets are large masses of ice that sit on the land. As our planet warms, this ice melts and flows into the oceans. More water in the oceans makes sea level higher.</p>

    <p>NASA satellites are constantly measuring sea level around the globe. <a href="https://climatekids.nasa.gov/sea-level/">Learn more about how we measure sea level with satellites</a>.</p>
